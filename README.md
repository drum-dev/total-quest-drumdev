### Description
Total Quest is an online real-world scavenger hunt application where contestants solve clues to find locations and will then scan QR codes with their phones or tablets to earn points. The contestant may choose to use the scavenger hunts generated by Total Quest or they may make their own by selecting locations from our database. If the contestant is unable to solve their given clue, they will spend points for another clue.  If the contestant is unable to solve the location after 3 clues they are then given the answer. After the scavenger hunt is complete, the contestant will be given a final score and may then rate or comment on their hunt.
